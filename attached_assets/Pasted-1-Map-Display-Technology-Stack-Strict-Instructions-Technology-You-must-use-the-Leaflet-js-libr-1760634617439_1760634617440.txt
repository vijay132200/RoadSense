1. Map Display & Technology Stack (Strict Instructions)
Technology: You must use the Leaflet.js library to build the map. Do not use other mapping libraries.

Map Visuals: To solve the gray background issue, you must use a detailed tile layer from OpenStreetMap. The map must look like a real, detailed city map with all streets, labels, and landmarks clearly visible.

2. Risk Calculation & Color Coding (Mandatory Formula)
Analyze the Dataset: You will use the Road Safety Dataset - Sheet1.csv.

Risk Formula: To classify the risk level of any given area, you will implement the following formula to calculate a Severity Score for each location. This is not a suggestion; you must use this exact logic:

Severity Score = (Total Fatalities * 10) + (Number of accidents with 'Severe' or 'Fatal' severity * 5) + (Number of accidents with 'Moderate' severity * 2)

Risk Thresholds & Color Coding: After calculating the Severity Score for each area, you will classify and color them on the map according to these rules:

High Risk (Red): Areas with a Severity Score in the top 25% of all scores.

Medium Risk (Yellow): Areas with a Severity Score between the 25th and 75th percentile.

Low Risk (Green): Areas with a Severity Score in the bottom 25% of all scores.

3. Actionable Suggestions (Deep Analysis Required)
Your suggestions for civilians and government must be intelligent and directly linked to the primary cause of accidents in the selected area. Do not provide generic advice. You must follow this logic:

First, for the selected location, identify the most frequent value in the cause_primary column. This is the "dominant cause."

Then, generate specific recommendations based on that dominant cause.

Example Rule 1: If the dominant cause is Bad Weather:

Government Suggestions: "Improve road infrastructure by clearing drainage systems to prevent waterlogging. Repair potholes that become hazardous in rain. Install high-visibility, reflective road markings and signage that perform well in fog and rain."

Civilian Suggestions: "Check tire tread and wiper blades before driving in rain. Reduce speed by at least 30% and increase following distance. Use fog lights in low visibility, not high beams."

Example Rule 2: If the dominant cause is Overspeeding:

Government Suggestions: "Install automated speed-enforcement cameras on this stretch. Implement traffic calming measures like speed bumps near intersections or pedestrian zones. Increase the frequency of traffic police patrols with speed guns."

Civilian Suggestions: "Be aware that this is a high-speed accident zone; adhere strictly to the posted speed limit. Allow extra time for your journey to avoid the temptation to speed. Be cautious of other vehicles making sudden maneuvers."

Example Rule 3: If the dominant cause is Driver Inattention or Red Light Violation:

Government Suggestions: "Improve traffic signal visibility and timing at this intersection. Install rumble strips on the approach to the intersection to alert drivers. Consider creating a 'no-right-on-red' policy here if not already in place."

Civilian Suggestions: "Avoid all mobile phone use when approaching this area. Be prepared for sudden stops. Before proceeding on a green light, quickly check for cross-traffic that may have run the red light."
